# Automated Teller Machine Integrated Chip

## Summary

Designed the finite-state machine for an ATM and designed an integrated chip at the transistor level

## Description

Demonstrated very large scale integration (VLSI) techniques by designing the finite-state machine of an automated teller machine and designing an integrated chip using software tools such as Cadence Virtuoso
