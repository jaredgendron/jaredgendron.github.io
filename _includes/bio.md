I am Jared Gendron, an electrical engineering graduate from the University of British Columbia (UBC). Throughout my academic journey I immersed myself in advanced courses covering analog circuit design, VLSI systems, power electronics, digital system design, and software engineering.

These studies provided me with a strong foundation in software development, circuit design, power electronics, and microcomputer systems. The interconnection among these advanced courses has formed a comprehensive skill set for myself which I am excited to leverage within a team of industry professionals. My aim is to continually refine my expertise and to actively contribute to your organizationâ€™s continued growth and success.
