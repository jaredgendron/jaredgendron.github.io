# The current home of `jgendron.ca`

A static website created using `github-pages` together with `Jekyll` which uses a combination of `HTML` and markdown documents for rendering. `SCSS` is used and compiled into CSS for better organization and `Javascript` is used for dynamic page elements.

To run the application locally at ***localhost***:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
