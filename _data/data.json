      "title": "3.5 DoF Robotic Arm",
      "image": "assets/images/RoboticArm/robot.png",
      "summary": "Took on the control engineering lead in a 3 person team designing a robotic arm with 3.5 degrees of freedom. Designed and fine-tuned a PID controller algorithm using MATLAB & Simulink and ported the algorithm to C for programming a microcontroller to control the robot. Ran thorough control and mechanical simulations of the design using a conjunction of MATLAB/Simulink and SimulationX software simultaneously by sharing feedback variables through computer ports"

      "title": "Digital IoT Parking Sign",
      "image": "assets/images/IoTParkingSign/sign.png",
      "summary": "The main point of the project was to create an innovative digital parking sign that dynamically adjusts its display based on real-time data. This sign can receive updates on an hourly schedule or respond to feedback from sensors, providing flexibility and adaptability. The project demonstrated strong leadership in overseeing the entire lifecycle, from conception to deployment, and employed robust engineering and wireless technologies to establish a seamless and secure connection between the sign and a web application."

      "title": "Puzzle Game iOS Application",
      "image": "assets/images/game.jpg",
      "summary": "The main point of the project was to design and develop an iOS puzzle game from scratch. The game incorporated a proprietary algorithm to generate an endless variety of unique and solvable puzzles, eliminating the need for manual level design and saving time and resources. Additionally, the team strategically integrated revenue-generating features, such as micro-transactions for new levels and advertisements, to ensure a successful and profitable application."
