## Summary

The main point of the project was to create an innovative digital parking sign that dynamically adjusts its display based on real-time data. Unlike a physical parking sign, this digital sign features an LCD display that can be changed dynamically to present different parking signs throughout the day. This sign can receive updates through a schedule, receive uploaded images, or respond to feedback from sensors, providing flexibility and adaptability. The project demonstrated strong leadership in overseeing the entire lifecycle, from conception to deployment, and employed robust engineering and wireless technologies to establish a seamless and secure connection between the sign and a web application.

## Description

The Dynamic Parking Sign Version 3 (DPSV3) project is the result of a collaborative effort by my final-year capstone team consisting of myself and four other engineering students. Our team worked closely with the University of British Columbia Parking and Access Services (UBC PAS) to conceptualize, design, and develop a groundbreaking solution for parking management. DPSV3 is the manifestation of their collective vision, representing an innovative and sustainable technology poised to revolutionize parking experiences at UBC and potentially beyond.

From its inception, DPSV3 was meticulously crafted to address the complex parking challenges faced by UBC. The compact design, with dimensions of 45cm in width and 60cm in height, ensures unobtrusiveness while delivering essential parking information. The device's display and enclosure revels a slim thickness, maximizing space efficiency. Its versatile mounting options, including standard poles and walls, were meticulously considered to enhance adaptability to diverse environments, a testament to the team's holistic approach to design.

A defining characteristic of DPSV3 is its durability. The device has an IP66 rating, guaranteeing resilience against the harshest weather conditions. The robust enclosure and components, designed for longevity, demonstrate the team's commitment to creating a product that can withstand the rigors of regular maintenance, installation, and five years of use.

The team ensured user-friendliness through a web application deployable on UBC's servers, providing the means to configure the device, create and edit hourly parking schedules, and authenticate users. Additionally, DPSV3's off-grid capability, with a minimum one-hour runtime and solar power integration, is a testament to the team's focus on energy-efficient solutions.

In terms of connectivity, DPSV3 excels. It connects to the internet via LTE, enabling real-time communication and updates. The web application, designed for diverse user devices, underscores the team's adaptability to evolving technologies.

The team designed DPSV3 to display a variety of parking signs, including accessible parking and time-limited parking, a testament to their attention to detail in addressing the diverse parking scenarios that arise on campus.

Modularity was a core design principle, with components designed for easy replacement and integration in future models. Serviceability, including field-replaceable parts, ensures long-term reliability without requiring specialized tools.

DPSV3's capability to rapidly change and update fully-loaded images on its display, within 30 seconds, reflects the team's commitment to user convenience and real-time responsiveness.

Beyond UBC, the project envisions DPSV3's scalability and potential adoption by organizations such as Easypark and Rogers. The team's clear, legible display design demonstrates their forward-thinking approach, making DPSV3 adaptable to various environments.

This capstone project has been a transformative experience for myself, offering invaluable opportunities for hands-on engineering, problem-solving, and project management. It enabled me to apply my classroom knowledge in a real-world context, improving my skills in design, technology integration, and collaboration. The journey of creating DPSV3 has been an instrumental chapter in my engineering education, demonstrating the immense potential of technology to address complex problems and benefit society.

In summary, the Dynamic Parking Sign Version 3 (DPSV3) project is a testament to the capabilities and dedication of our final-year capstone team. As a collaborative endeavor, it exemplifies my ability to design and develop practical solutions that not only cater to specific client needs but also offer the potential for broader impact. DPSV3 is a remarkable milestone in my journey, showcasing my capacity to innovate, adapt, and contribute to the ever-evolving field of engineering.
