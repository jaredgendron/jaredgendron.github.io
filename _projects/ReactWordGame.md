## Summary

This project showcases a meticulously designed web application that seamlessly integrates a React front-end and NodeJS back-end to offer an engaging word puzzle experience. By combining riddle-solving challenges with word-guessing gameplay, players are tasked with deciphering clues to unveil a hidden word, all within a limited number of attempts and the option to use up to two hints. The game's dynamic, user-friendly interface encourages players to put their linguistic skills to the test, while the social element enables sharing of scores with friends, fostering a sense of friendly competition and collaboration. The integration of RESTful APIs ensures real-time data exchange between the components, providing a seamless and immersive gaming experience for word enthusiasts and problem solvers alike.

## Description

The web application was meticulously crafted with a front-end built using the React library and a back-end powered by NodeJS. React's component-based architecture allowed for the creation of a clean, responsive, and highly interactive user interface. This design ensures that players can easily navigate through the game screen, whether on a desktop or a mobile device. The React front-end, through its dynamic capabilities, allows players to enjoy a smooth and engaging experience. Meanwhile, the NodeJS back-end was designed to manage core game logic, including riddle generation, word verification, and player data storage. Leveraging NodeJS's event-driven and asynchronous nature, the back-end architecture was built to accommodate scalability and the potential for a growing user base while maintaining seamless gameplay.

The web-based application offers a unique blend of riddle-solving and word-guessing challenges. Players are presented with a riddle that serves as a clue to identify the hidden word. The challenge lies in deciphering these riddles and using their linguistic skills to guess the word correctly. With a limited number of attempts, players can utilize up to two hints to guide them in the right direction. The game tracks player scores and progress, creating a sense of achievement and competition. Moreover, a social aspect allows players to share their progress and score with friends, facilitating friendly competition and collaboration. The player is able to input their guess using the on-screen keyboard or with their own keyboard.

A crucial aspect of the design was ensuring seamless communication between the React front-end and NodeJS back-end. To facilitate this, RESTful APIs were implemented. The integration between the front-end and back-end ensures that players can enjoy a continuous gaming experience and observe real-time updates, creating an immersive and engaging gameplay environment.

In summary, the web application was thoughtfully designed with a React front-end and a NodeJS back-end to provide players with an immersive and seamless gaming experience. The user-friendly interface, combined with the responsive design, enhances user interaction, while the back-end manages game logic and data storage efficiently. The integration between the two components ensures real-time updates and secure communication, making the application a well-rounded and engaging platform for word enthusiasts.
