# Robotic Arm with 3.5 Degrees of Freedom

## Summary

Took on the control engineering lead in a 3 person team designing a robotic arm with 3.5 degrees of freedom. Designed and fine-tuned a PID controller algorithm using MATLAB & Simulink and ported the algorithm to C for programming a microcontroller to control the robot. Ran thorough control and mechanical simulations of the design using a conjunction of MATLAB/Simulink and SimulationX software simultaneously by sharing feedback variables through computer ports

## Description

In this project, I was responsible for designing the complete control system of a robot featuring 3.5 degrees of freedom. To achieve precise and efficient control, I developed and fine-tuned a PID controller in C, efficiently utilizing a microcontroller's main running program and interrupt service routines. To optimize the controller for minimal processing time, I conducted real-time simulations using a combination of MATLAB and SimulationX software simulataneously. This allowed me to fine-tune the system parameters and ensure optimal performance ahead of real-time testing. To demonstrate my circuit design skills, I created a printed circuit board to drive current to the motors, minimizing the robot's overall footprint. Moreover, I implemented an algorithm that autonomously operated one motor based on the positions of the other two, drastically reducing path planning time and enhancing the robot's autonomous capabilities.
