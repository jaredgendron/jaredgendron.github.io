## Summary

The main point of this project was to design and develop an iOS puzzle game from scratch. The game incorporated an algorithm to generate an endless variety of unique and solvable puzzles, eliminating the need for manual level design and saving time and resources. Additionally, the team strategically integrated revenue-generating features, such as micro-transactions for new levels and advertisements, to ensure a successful and profitable application.


## Description

As a two-person team, we collaborated closely to design and develop an iOS puzzle game from scratch, while also focusing on understanding the underlying business aspects of the application.

From the beginning of the design process, we incorporated elements to enhance the app's revenue potential and user experience. To ensure a captivating and constantly evolving gaming experience, we created an algorithm that generated an endless number of unique and solvable puzzles automatically. This algorithm would not only delight players with fresh challenges but also save man-hours that would have otherwise been required for manual level design.

Understanding the significance of generating revenue, we strategically integrated micro-transactions within the game design, this would allow users to purchase new levels or additional in-game content, thereby enhancing user engagement and monetization opportunities. Additionally, we proactively considered the inclusion of advertisements at appropriate intervals to strike a balance between ensuring a seamless user experience and creating opportunities for ad revenue.

Throughout the project, our focus on both technical innovation and understanding the business behind the application allowed us to deliver a well-designed iOS game. This approach not only catered to gameplay but also laid the foundation for potential revenue growth through micro-transactions and advertisements, increasing the probability of its success and making it a profitable venture.
